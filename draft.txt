use cases:

get elevation points of the supporting points of a linestring
get elevation points evenly spaced on a line string (input number of points)
get elevation points spaced in fixed distance on a line string (input distance)

automatic convert inputs to crs of raster (and reconvert the outputs)

return: 

elevation above seelevel

calculations:

get incline profile (input height profile, ouput avg inclines between points)
linearly interpolate between brunnels
	input elevations, distances, array of bools where should linearly interpolate
smooth elevation profile
subtract forest areas / urban areas (rougheness index?)
calculate cumulative ascent / descent

plots:
plot hieght profile x distance, y height
plot incline profile x distance, y incline
